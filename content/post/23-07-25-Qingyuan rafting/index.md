On July 25, 2023, our research group embarked on our first team-building activity at Qingyuan's Gulongxia, experiencing white-water rafting. This event not only thrilled us with its challenging rapids but also strengthened our bonds as a team. After rafting, we shared a meal and exchanged stories about research and life, making this team-building event a truly memorable experience.
